BACKGROUND INFO
-------------------------------------
Originally written back in 2002, this was designed as the backend for
three separate webcomics run by friends (‘Megadome All-Stars’, ‘Into the
Black’, and ‘The Misadventures of Magus and Mog’) on a webhost which did
not provide a database. However, as is often the case with such things,
all three of those webcomics eventually ceased to be.

After about a year, I decided it was time to clean up the code a (little)
bit, fix some bugs, and make it available to the Internet at large. It’s
still rough around the edges, but I think it does a pretty nice job of
administering a webcomic without needing a database. Not really very
configurable at all, unless you know PHP- but some people may find it
useful, nonetheless.

I believe that there are now more robust alternatives to this available,
but I am not familiar with any of them. You should probably shop around a
bit before settling on this program, but it is possible that it will still
suit your needs.


KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------
* It uses extremely weak HTTP authentication. Do not administer over WiFi.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------------------
First off, I hope you have PHP >= 4.0.5 and Apache running, otherwise I
probably won't be able to help you if you can't get it working.

1. Upload files to web directory, set permissions, ensuring the following
	files/folders are writable to by the user your web server runs as.
		archives
		gallery
		gallery/gallery.txt
		rant
2. Edit the config file (includes/comic_config.php) to match your setup
	A. Set the paths- $home, $path, and $comic_dir
	B. Pick a umask that works
	C. Add real users, as opposed to the default ones
3. Set up your .htpasswd file:
	htpasswd .htpasswd user1 (for each user)
4. Set up an .htaccess file in the admin directory to point to the
	.htpasswd file you just made.
6. Install avatars as <username>.<gif|jpg|png|...> into images/avatars
7. Configure files (mainly header.php and footer.php, but the individual
	content files as well) to display the way you want them to.  Edit
	the included stylesheet as desired.
8. Start uploading comics, and play around with it  :)
